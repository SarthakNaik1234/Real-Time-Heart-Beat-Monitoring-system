# REAL-TIME HEARTBEAT MONITORING SYSTEM USING 8051 MICRO CONTROLLER 
 
OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT : 
The objective of the Heartbeat Sensor Project with the 8051 
microcontroller is to build a compact and efficient system to monitor 
and display heart rate. The 8051 microcontroller reads the analog signal 
from a heart rate sensor, converts it into a digital value, and shows the 
heart rate on a display. This project demonstrates key concepts like 
sensor interfacing, analog-to-digital conversion, and display operations 
within an embedded system. It provides hands-on experience with 
microcontroller applications, particularly in the field of health 
monitoring, and serves as a foundation for developing future biomedical 
systems using microcontrollers.
